Q1: What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?
By multiplying each level in a different coefficient we gain control upon the significance of each level.
Each level in a laplacian pyramid is built by subtracting the blurred-reduced-expanded image from the
original image. We can look at the blur-reduce-expand process as a high pass filter of the image's frequencies.
And this is why each level in the pyramid is an image of the low frequqncies of the level before it.
This is why multiplying by different coefficients allows us to control the intensity of each frequency in the blended
image.
