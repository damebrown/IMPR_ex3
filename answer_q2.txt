Q3: What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending is performed with different image filters
(filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...)?

The bigger filter_size_im is, the bigger the blurring gaussian filter is. The gaussian filter is used
in the blurring process which we apply on the photo while expanding and reducing the image. The blurring is
the process giving the pyramid blending the smooth passing between each of the original photo's area.
This is why the larger the filter_size_im is, the larger the gaussian filter is, the bigger the area each blurring is
active upon, and the bigger and smoother blending area in the blended image.
